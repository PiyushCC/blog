# Getting Started with Eleventy

Eleventy (11ty) is a simple static site generator that turns markdown and templates into HTML. Here's why it's great for blogs.

## Why Eleventy?

- **Zero config** – Works out of the box with sensible defaults.
- **Fast** – Builds complete sites in seconds.
- **Flexible** – Use Nunjucks, Liquid, Markdown, or mix them.

## Quick start

```bash
npm init -y
npm install @11ty/eleventy
npx eleventy --serve
```

Add a few markdown files and you're off. No database, no runtime – just static files ready for GitHub Pages or any host.

## Next steps

Explore collections, custom filters, and the plugin ecosystem. Happy building!
