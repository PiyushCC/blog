# Welcome

This is a **sample post** to show how markdown is rendered. Add more `.md` files in the `posts/` folder to create new blog posts.

## Features

- Listing page
- Blog pages with images
- Markdown-only authoring
- Search, TOC, sidebar
- GitHub comments, archive, tags and categories

## Code example

```js
function greet(name) {
  return `Hello, ${name}!`;
}
console.log(greet("Reader"));
```

## Image example

You can add images with standard markdown: place files in `assets/` or `posts/images/` and reference them:
