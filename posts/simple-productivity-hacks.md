# Simple Productivity Hacks for Developers

Small habits that can save time and focus.

## Write it down

Keep a short list of today's priorities. One file or one note is enough. Update it at the start of the day and when something new lands. You avoid "what was I doing?" and context switches.

## Automate the boring stuff

If you run the same commands or do the same edits often, script them. A one-line alias or a small script pays off after a few uses. Don't over-engineer – just remove the repetition.

## Single-task when it matters

For hard bugs or design decisions, close the extra tabs and notifications. Even 20 minutes of focused work beats an hour of interrupted multitasking.

Start with one of these and see what sticks. Consistency beats intensity.
