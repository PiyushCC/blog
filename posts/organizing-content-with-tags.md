# Organizing Content with Tags and Categories

A little structure helps readers find what they need.

## Tags vs categories

**Categories** are broad buckets – e.g. "Development", "Design", "General". A post usually has one category (or a primary one).

**Tags** are finer-grained – "javascript", "eleventy", "tutorial". A post can have several. Tags are great for "more like this" and filtering.

## In your front matter

```yaml
---
title: My Post
category: Development
tags:
  - javascript
  - tips
---
```

Use both: categories for navigation and sections, tags for search and related content. Keep tag names consistent (lowercase, hyphenated) so listing pages stay clean.
