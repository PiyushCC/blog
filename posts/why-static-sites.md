# Why Static Sites Still Make Sense

Dynamic frameworks are powerful, but for blogs and docs, static has real advantages.

## Speed and reliability

No database, no server-side rendering on each request. You serve HTML, CSS, and JS. CDNs cache it; uptime is excellent.

## Security and cost

Nothing to hack on the server. No runtime to patch. Hosting is often free (GitHub Pages, Netlify, Cloudflare Pages).

## Authoring flow

Write in markdown, run a build, deploy. No CMS to maintain. Content lives in the repo – versioned, reviewable, and portable.

Static isn't for every project, but for many blogs and documentation sites, it's the right fit.
