# Markdown Tips for Bloggers

A few habits that make markdown posts easier to write and maintain.

## Use consistent heading levels

Start with one `#` for the title (often set by front matter), then `##` for main sections and `###` for subsections. This keeps your table of contents clean and your structure clear.

## Link meaningfully

Prefer **descriptive link text** over raw URLs or "click here". Screen readers and search engines both benefit.

## Keep code blocks labeled

Always specify the language in fenced code blocks so syntax highlighting works:

````markdown
```javascript
const x = 42;
```
````

Small touches like these make your content more readable and more professional.
